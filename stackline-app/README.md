## Notes
Currently the fetch call is to a local json file. If you replace it with an API call it will still work. I originally used Mockcoon to mock that GET response but since the app needs to be hosted it is easier to make that a local json file. 

## Credits
This App was bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

This App uses the Material UI ['Material-UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/) and some of the components are modifications of examples

## Getting Started
Go into the `/stackline-app` directory and run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
